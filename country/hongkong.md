# Hong Kong
The Unsolicited Electronic Messages Ordinance regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages in Hong Kong. It came into force in December 2007.

## Content required
All emails sent for marketing purposes should have a clear identification of the sender. The law requires you to have these as compulsory data to be mentioned in your marketing emails.

## Consent
You can only send marketing emails to those who have provided implied consent to receive marketing emails from you.

## Penalties
There are large maximum fines that can be levied as penalties in the event of a breach that can go up to 1 million HKD and imprisonment for up to 5 years on conviction on indictment.

The fine and imprisonment depends on the regulating body and can vary based on what scale the law was breached.
