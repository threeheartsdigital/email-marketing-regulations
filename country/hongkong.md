Hong Kong’s government made “The Unsolicited Electronic Messages Ordinance” and it came to act in December 2007 that regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages.

## Content required

All emails sent for marketing purposes should have a clear identification of the sender. The law requires you to have these as compulsory data to be mentioned in your marketing emails.

## Consent

You can only send marketing emails to those who have provided implied consent to receive marketing emails from you.

## Penalties

There are large maximum fines that can be levied as penalties in the event of a breach that can go up to $1,000,000 and imprisonment for up to 5 years on conviction on indictment.

The fine and imprisonment depends on the regulating body and can vary based on what scale the law was breached.
