# Belgium

Belgium has 2 laws that govern email marketing and other forms of electronic marketing. These are outre-Quiévrain law and EU GDPR. Both laws combined cover all aspects of electronic marketing in Belgium.

## Content required

All emails sent for marketing purposes should have a clear identification of the sender name, mailing address and a clear identification of the sender. The law requires you to have these as compulsory data to be mentioned in your marketing emails.

## Consent

You can only send marketing emails to those who have provided explicit consent to receive marketing emails from you.

This can be either by having a double opt-in or by checking an explicit checkbox while subscribing.

## Notable exceptions or requirements

Belgium requires that companies have a data security officer. The person is in charge of maintaining and enforcing data security standards.

## Penalties

The maximum fine available under the GDPR is up to €20 million, or 4% annual global turnover – whichever is higher. Though this is the maximum fine and "Data Protection Authority" will govern this.

Also the fine under outre-Quiévrain law will be decided on a case to case basis.
