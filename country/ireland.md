# Ireland
Ireland has two laws that govern email marketing and other forms of electronic marketing; the Irish Data Protection Act 2018 and EU GDPR.

## Content required
All emails sent for marketing purposes should have a clear identification of the sender name, mailing address and a clear identification of the sender. The law requires you to have these as compulsory data to be mentioned in your marketing emails.

## Consent
You can only send marketing emails to those who have provided explicit consent to receive marketing emails from you.

This can be either by having a double opt-in or by checking an explicit checkbox while subscribing with your privacy policy link mentioned there.

## Notable exceptions or requirements
As Ireland follows GDPR, it requires that companies have a data security officer. The person is in charge of maintaining and enforcing data security standards.

## Penalties
The maximum fine available under the GDPR is up to 20 million EUR, or 4% annual global turnover â€“ whichever is higher. The "Data Protection Commissioner" is the supervisory authority.

In addition to a fine under GDPR, the Irish government can also impose a fine up to 250,000 EUR per message sent by a company and an individual may be fined up to 50,000 EUR per message
