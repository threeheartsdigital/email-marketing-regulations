# Ireland

Ireland has 2 laws that govern email marketing and other forms of electronic marketing. These are the Irish Data Protection Act 2018 and EU GDPR. Both laws combined cover all aspects of electronic marketing in Denmark.

## Content required

All emails sent for marketing purposes should have a clear identification of the sender name, mailing address and a clear identification of the sender. The law requires you to have these as compulsory data to be mentioned in your marketing emails.

## Consent

You can only send marketing emails to those who have provided explicit consent to receive marketing emails from you.

This can be either by having a double opt-in or by checking an explicit checkbox while subscribing with your privacy policy link mentioned there.

## Notable exceptions or requirements

As Ireland follows GDPR, it requires that companies have a data security officer. The person is in charge of maintaining and enforcing data security standards.

## Penalties

There are large maximum fines that can be levied as penalties in the event of a breach, however the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has repeatedly said that it would not make early examples of organisations for minor infringements of the GDPR, nor would maximum fines become the norm.

The maximum fine available under the GDPR is up to €20 million, or 4% annual global turnover – whichever is higher.

In addition to a fine under GDPR, the  Irish government will also impose a fine up to EUR 250,000 per message sent by a company and an individual may be fined up to EUR 50,000 per message
