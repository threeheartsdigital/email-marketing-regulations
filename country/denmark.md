# Denmark
Denmark has two laws that govern email marketing and other forms of electronic marketing. These are the Denmark Marketing Practices Act and EU GDPR. Both laws combined cover all aspects of electronic marketing in Denmark.

## Content required
All emails sent for marketing purposes should have a clear identification of the sender name, mailing address and a clear identification of the sender. The law requires you to have these as compulsory data to be mentioned in your marketing emails.

## Consent
You can only send marketing emails to those who have provided explicit consent to receive marketing emails from you.

This can be either by having a double opt-in or by checking an explicit checkbox while subscribing with your privacy policy link mentioned there.

## Notable exceptions or requirements
As Denmark follows GDPR, it requires that companies have a data security officer. The person is in charge of maintaining and enforcing data security standards.

## Penalties
The maximum fine available under the GDPR is up to 20 million EUR, or 4% annual global turnover â€“ whichever is higher. The Danish Data Protection Agency, created under the implementation of EU Directive 95/46/EC, is the governing body.

In addition to a fine under GDPR, the Danish government will impose an additional fine, which is to be decided by the governing body.
