# China
China's email marketing regulations are set out in the Regulations of Email Services (RES). These regulations are far stricter than those seen in other countries.

## Required content
The RES requires email marketers to make sure recipients are aware they are receiving promotional content but putting "AD" in their subject lines. Email content must not violate the Regulations of Telecommunication in the People's Republic of China. In general, this means that politically sensitive or mature content is prohibited. This includes advertisements for pornography, firearms, gambling, tobacco and illegal drugs. Senders must also ensure they provide contact information to ensure recipients are able to unsubscribe.

## Consent
The RES requires consent before sending emails can be sent, however the opt-in methods are not specified. It is recommended to follow the same consent measures as stipulated in the CAN-SPAM Act.

## Notable exceptions or requirements
Recipients must be able to opt-out from receiving emails.

## Penalties
Violations of the RES are subject to fines of up to 10,000 CNY. For cases that involve illegal content, fines can be up to 30,000 CNY. The penalties are enforced through a report-based system, where consumers file an official complaint about illegal email activity.
