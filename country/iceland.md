# Iceland
Iceland solely follows EU GDPR to cover and regulate all aspects of electronic marketing in Iceland.

## Content required
All emails sent for marketing purposes should have a mention of the sender name, mailing address and a clear identification of the sender. The law requires you to have these as compulsory data to be mentioned in your marketing emails.

## Consent
You can only send marketing emails to those who have provided explicit consent to receive marketing emails from you.

This can be either by having a double opt-in or by checking an explicit checkbox while subscribing with your privacy policy link mentioned there.

## Notable exceptions or requirements
As Iceland follows GDPR, it requires that companies have a data security officer. The person is in charge of maintaining and enforcing data security standards.

## Penalties
The maximum fine available under the GDPR is up to 20 million EUR, or 4% annual global turnover – whichever is higher. The Data Protection Authority or Persónuvernd is the supervisory authority.
