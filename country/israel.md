Israel’s government made “Protection of Privacy Law on Direct Mailing” to regulate the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages.

## Content required

All emails sent for marketing purposes should have a clear identification of the sender. The law requires you to have these as compulsory data to be mentioned in your marketing emails.

## Consent

You can only send marketing emails to those who have provided explicit consent to receive marketing emails from you.

The recipient can also be sent marketing emails if they shared their contact info, when purchasing a service or product, or when negotiating such purchase (specified for general advertising, which includes marketing emails)

## Penalties

The fine that would be imposed would depend on the severity of breach of the law and could go up to ILS 202,000.
