# Israel

Israel’s government uses Section 30A of the Communications Broadcasting Law to regulate the sending of unsolicited commercial emails. The amendment was introduced in December 2008 and dictates that an advertiser may not send an advertisement by fax, automatic dialing system, electronic message (email) or SMS, without obtaining the recipient’s explicit consent in advance and in writing.

## Content required

The law sets out that those who want to send an advertising email must clearly highlight it is an advert and include your name, address and contact details. The recipient must also be able to unsubscribe from those emails.

## Consent

You can only send marketing emails to those who have provided explicit consent to receive marketing emails from you.

The recipient can also be sent marketing emails if they shared their contact info, when purchasing a service or product, or when negotiating such purchase (specified for general advertising, which includes marketing emails)

## Penalties

The fine that would be imposed would depend on the severity of breach of the law and could go up to ILS 202,000 in a criminal court. Recipients of spam email may also seek damages which in a civil court could be as much as ILS 1,000 for each message sent by the advertiser to the recipient.
