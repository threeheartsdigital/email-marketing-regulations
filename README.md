# Email marketing regulations around the world

As the world becomes increasingly connected, the email marketing regulation landscape becomes more and more complex. Whether or not you operate directly in different countries, it's good practice as an email marketer to know which laws and regulations apply to your subscribers, wherever they are in the world. In recent years, keeping on top of new legislation has been challenging – most notably in Europe, with the introduction of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).

The team at [EmailOctopus](https://emailoctopus.com/?utm_source=github) have compiled this guide to make things easier. Our aim is to create a space where the email marketing community can keep each other up-to-date about regulations around the world, so it's easier for us all to be aware of new legislation, as and when it's implemented.

## Explicit vs implied consent and other key terms

#### Explicit consent
Explicit consent gives the individual or business the right to deal with personal data. Consent can be acquired in writing or verbally. Generally speaking you'll need to keep a record of consent collection.

A typical example in email marketing is a website registration form. Some legislations will require that you include a check-box to allow customers to consent to receiving your newsletter.

- **_Soft opt-in_**: When you've collected an email address as part of another process, such as a purchase flow, and can reasonably assume the customer will be happy to receive further communications. However, you must have given them a clear chance to opt out – both when you first collected their details, and in every future message you send.
- **_Single opt-in_**: A one step opt-in, so only a registration form is filled out. 
- **_Double opt-in_**: A multi-step opt-in, so the registration is confirmed via a link sent to the acquired email address.

#### Implied consent
Implied consent, also known as inferred consent, is usually derived from actions and circumstances, often a previous purchase or enquiry.

The best example is during online shopping. Imagine a customer has just bought a games console from your online store. You may assume that the client is interested in games and wish to contact them after their initial purchase with other similar products. If you haven't specifically asked to contact this user again (via a checkbox or similar), this is called implied consent. 

The exact boundaries for both types of consent are defined in the specific country laws.
